gtkglext-3
----------

Replay requires gtkglext-3 - this is available from
https://github.com/tdz/gtkglext

git clone https://github.com/tdz/gtkglext
cd gtkglext
./bootstrap
./configure --prefix=/usr
make
sudo make install


Compiling Replay from git
-------------------------

When compiling Replay from git (as opposed to using a source tarball),
you will need to use the autogen.sh script instead of configure (as
configure is only built when distributing source tarballs).


Fedora
------

When compiling on Fedora a couple more options are required - when
building both gtkglext-3 and Replay for x86-64, ensure the flag:

--libdir=/usr/lib64

is appended to the autogen.sh / ./configure command for both gtkglext
and Replay.

Also to ensure Replay is able to find gtkglext-3, the following
environment variable is required to be set when running autogen.sh /
configure on Fedora:

PKG_CONFIG_PATH=${PKG_CONFIG_PATH}:/usr/lib/pkgconfig/

For more information on installing from a source tarball refer to the
INSTALL file
